Test Automation in my current project.

I am currently working on the project related to platform for education where we have at least two test automation teams to ensure the quality and stability of our software.

EPAM Test Automation Team

Our internal test automation team (all members of which are from EPAM) is responsible for automating test cases for the features that have already been released. 
They have their own dedicated environment where they execute their automated tests. This team focuses on regression testing and ensuring that the existing functionality continues to work as expected with further development of the features.
They leverage various automation frameworks and tools to write and maintain their test cases.

Customer Test Automation Team

We also collaborate with our customer's test automation team during the releases. They perform automated tests on the production environment whenever a new release is conducted, this team runs their automated test suite to validate that the old functionality is still functioning correctly without any issues. 
Their tests help us ensure that the software is working as expected in the production environment after each release.

Both test automation teams play a crucial role in maintaining the quality of our software and reducing the manual effort required for regression testing. 
The use of test automation allows us to detect issues in old functionality early and ensure the stability of our product.
